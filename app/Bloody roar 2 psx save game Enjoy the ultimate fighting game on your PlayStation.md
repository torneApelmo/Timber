Bloody Roar 2 is a fighting game that was released for the PlayStation in 1999. It features 12 characters that can transform into powerful beasts during combat. The game has various modes, such as story, arcade, versus, survival, and custom. To unlock all the characters, costumes, endings, and secrets, you need to complete the game multiple times with different characters and settings.
 
However, if you don't want to spend hours playing the game over and over again, you can download and use save game files that have everything unlocked for you. Save game files are data files that store your progress and settings in a game. You can use them to resume your game from where you left off, or to access features that you haven't unlocked yet.
